/**
 * The Renderer store works a little bit interestingly.
 * It is still a fully-fledged Redux store, but its only purpose
 * is to mirror the state of the main process store.
 *
 * The main process store has a middleware that emits IPC events
 * when it changes, which are available through Store.onStateChange.
 * The renderer store has a listener that listens for these events
 * and updates its state. It does this by dispatching an "action"
 * with the same name as the original action with a "@@main/" prefix, but with a payload
 * that is the new state. Meanwhile the renderer reducer just
 * replaces the state with the payload. That way Redux DevTools
 * still works in the renderer process.
 *
 * Meanwhile, actions from the renderer process are dispatched to the main
 * process store through the MainStoreAPI.dispatch object. We use a middleware
 * to ensure that any usage of useDispatch in the renderer process is caught.
